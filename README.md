# Wine Quality Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts wine quality based on various chemical properties using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The project uses a dataset of red wine samples to predict wine quality ratings on a scale of 3-8. It implements both Linear Regression and Random Forest models for comparison.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Linear Regression model
- Random Forest model with hyperparameter optimization
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Feature importance analysis

## Requirements

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/moanv2/Red_Wine_Analysis.git>
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main analysis script:
```bash
python wine_quality_analysis.py
```

## Results

The analysis includes:
- Distribution of wine quality ratings
- Comparison of model performances
- Visualization of predictions vs actual values
- Feature importance ranking

## Data Source

The dataset used is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
